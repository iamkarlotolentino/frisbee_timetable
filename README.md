#### THIS PROJECT
## An application of Genetic Algorithm in Student-Lecture Timetable System

------------

#### Preparing a student-lecture timetable is an exhaustive task for every colleges. The proposed timetabling system requires minimal effort from the adminstration staff, and solves the time-consuming task.

The proposed timetabling system was divided into three stages: The first stage is the data collection. In this stage, the adminstrative staff is responsible for preparing the data. In the second stage, the program generates an initial set of suggested schedules (chromosomes). Each chromosomes represents a solutino the problem, but usually is not satisfactory. Finally, the proposed timetabling system starts the search for a good solution that satisfies teh best interests of the college according to a cost function. GA is applied in the search for a satisfactory schedule based on a predefined criterion.

#####**HARD CONSTRAINTS**
1. One subject per room at a certain timeslot.
2. The lecture room or laboratories must be able to accomodate all students in a section.
3. A subject must not be taught in a single day.
4. A student can only attend one subject at a time.
5. Classes should be start within at 7AM till 6PM.

#####**SOFT CONSTRAINTS**:
1. Lunch time should within 10AM-12PM.
2. Classes' timeframe should be compact and centered in between 7AM - 6PM.
3. A break for every two consecutive lectures/laboratories.
